/**
 * Normal distribution with parameters miu and sigma, where miu is the center of the density and sigma is a measure of the spread of the distribution
 * <p>
 * The density function is: 1/sqrt(2*PI*sigma) * e^(-(x-miu)^2) / 2 * sigma^2
 * <p>
 * The inverse of the normal function cannot be writen in  closed form => the normal algo to use f-1(x) to simulate the distribution cannot be used.
 * <p>
 * It can be however simulated by the following fact: if U and V are random variables with uniform densities on [0..1], the the random variables:
 * X = sqrt(-2*logU)* cos(2*PI*V) and X = sqrt(-2*logU)* sing (2*PI*V) are independent and have the normal distribution.
 * <p>
 * A normal Z random variable with parameters miu = 0 and sigma = 1 is a 'standard' normal variable
 * <p>
 * A random variable defined as X = sigma*Z + miu has a normal distribution with parameters sigma and miu
